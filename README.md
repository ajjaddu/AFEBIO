Multiomics integration is a technique that combines multiple sources of biological data to obtain a more complete and accurate view of biological processes. An application in R Shiny has been developed to facilitate this task for users with little knowledge of bioinformatics. This tool allows the integration and visualisation of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and other data in a single interactive and easy-to-use platform. In addition, the application provides several statistical tools to analyse and explore the integrated data. With this application, even users with no experience in bioinformatics can perform multi-omics analysis and obtain valuable information about complex biological processes.
